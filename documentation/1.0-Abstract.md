# Abstract

Pronounce: PD I SEE

Can you see the portable data iterface in this program ?

[Why clang ?](https://clang.llvm.org/index.html)

- Fast compiles and low memory use
- Expressive diagnostics (examples)
- GCC compatibility
- Modular library based architecture
- Support diverse clients (refactoring, static analysis, code generation, etc.)
- A real-world, production quality compiler
- A simple and hackable code base
- A single unified parser for C, Objective C, C++, and Objective C++
- Conformance with C/C++/ObjC and their variants

This project can see [PDI Portable Data Interface](https://gitlab.maisondelasimulation.fr/pdidev/pdi) representation in c/c++.
